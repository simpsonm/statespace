statespace
==========

This repository is a collection of a couple of state space modeling projects originating in an RA with Jarad Niemi in Summer, 2013. Currently there are two main components:

1. An exploration of different sampling methods for linear, gaussian state space models. The ultimate goal is to come up with an interweaving type strategy that (hopefully) converges faster than other approaches.

2. An applied project analyzing data from an ecological experiment exploring the impacts of global warming. The data from this experiment is 65 univariate time series each of around 3000 observations.
