things to do:

1) Fix the bibliography - currently it repeats author's names instead of replacing with dashes.

2) Iterate discussion and abstract. Anything missing from discussion?

3) Get supplementary materials in order. Code in particular.

4) After supplementary materials are in order, fix the supplementary materials section at the end.

See this re: subheadings

Headings. The main body of the article should be divided by appropriate numbered section and subsection headings. Main headings are typed in all uppercase letters and centered; when numbering use arabic numerals followed by a period (e.g., 1. INTRODUCTION, 2. ANALYSIS OF DATA). When subheadings are needed, be sure to use no fewer than two under a main heading. They should be typed in upper- and lowercase letters, flush with the left margin; do not underline. Use arabic numerals in the following style: 1.1 Review of the Literature, 1.2 New Methods, and so forth. Sometimes a third level of headings is required. Whenever possible, ASA prefers to use an indented, underlined, upper- and lowercase paragraph heading ending with a period.
