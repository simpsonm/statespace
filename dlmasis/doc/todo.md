**To Do:**

* Fix the bibliography - currently it repeats author's names instead of replacing with dashes.

* Iterate discussion and abstract. Anything missing from discussion?

* Find material that can be cut - goal: under 25 pages

* Cover letter

* Blinded version

For future reference, see this re: subheadings

Headings. The main body of the article should be divided by appropriate numbered section and subsection headings. Main headings are typed in all uppercase letters and centered; when numbering use arabic numerals followed by a period (e.g., 1. INTRODUCTION, 2. ANALYSIS OF DATA). When subheadings are needed, be sure to use no fewer than two under a main heading. They should be typed in upper- and lowercase letters, flush with the left margin; do not underline. Use arabic numerals in the following style: 1.1 Review of the Literature, 1.2 New Methods, and so forth. Sometimes a third level of headings is required. Whenever possible, ASA prefers to use an indented, underlined, upper- and lowercase paragraph heading ending with a period.
