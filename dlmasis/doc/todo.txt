1) Make sure Jarad and Vivek get their info into the submission system

2) References to the applied literature (asks Referee 3) --- do we really need this? It will make the paper longer, and we are already just barely at 30 pages.

Add a sentence explaining that which regime holds is application-specific. In review response, cite our length restriction.

3) Line number references are incorrect --- fix this just before submission (they will add line numbers to our submission, that's what we should use).

4) Should we cut anymore? We are so close to the desired 28 pages. I could probably cut ~1 page from the discussion that is somewhat extraneous --- it mostly points at further work dealing with the multivariate case efficiently. Some of that can go in an appendix, or maybe it isn't necessary at all. I'm not sure where the other page could come from.


Make cover letter separate, fix thing above, then send everything out again (today/tomorrow)
     use editor's official address in cover letter (Thomas Lee).
     make sure to thank everyone in the first line.
     remove "anonymous" from the acks, thank editor



(DONE!)
