Monday, July 6 meet at 1pm

1) Make sure Jarad and Vivek get their info into the submission system

2) References to the applied literature (asks Referee 3) --- do we really need this?

3) Line number references are incorrect --- fix this just before submission (they will add line numbers to our submission, that's what we should use).

4) Should we cut anymore? We are so close to the desired 28 pages. I could probably cut ~1 page from the discussion that is somewhat extraneous --- it mostly points at further work dealing with the multivariate case efficiently. Some of that can go in an appendix, or maybe it isn't necessary at all. I'm not sure where the other page could come from.
