For arguing our sample size is large enough to estimate ESS:
    mention that nothing changed when increasing sample size
    redo the procedure for n=3000 on just 1 cell of the grid to get some idea of the monte carlo variability of ESS
    	 pick one good cell/sampler combination and one bad
    
One of the reviewers suggests a method of constructing CIS samplers - mention his method then mention that we show you can improve on computational time by removing extraneous steps.

See if we can change the formatting of the authors to not repeat Jarad & Vivek's department, add an acknowledgements section (acknowledge reviewer's points, especially one from above)

Change math environments: don't use align for 1 line math environments, use \[ \]
       (Use \qquad to make space on one line, try negative \vspace to save whitespace vertically)

Don't forget to thank editor + reviewrs in the response file
