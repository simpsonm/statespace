things to do:

add subsections to intro and DLM sections
some lit review stuff is still floating in dlmasisOLD.tex - add it.
check full document for coherence
particularly discussion & results, but also where some abbreviations are introduced and so forth.
Make it shorter! (probably)
Couple \jarads left
Cite Jarad & Ignatio's paper
Change labels of algorithms in plots.
beef up discussion, perhaps.
spell check, obv
add promised stuff to appendix
