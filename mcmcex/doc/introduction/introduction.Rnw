\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
Much is known about constructing efficient Gibbs samplers in multilevel models --- e.g. see \citet{van2001art} and \citet{papaspiliopoulos2007general}, but little work has been done in improving Gibbs samplers in time series models despite some strong similarities in the structure of the models. In one example, \citet{fruhwirth2004efficient} applies the ideas of this literature to a dynamic univariate regression model with a stationary AR(1) process on the regression coefficient. In another, \cite{pitt1999analytic} computes analytic convergence rates for in a Gibbs sampler for a stationary AR(1) plus noise model. One recent idea to come out of the Gibbs sampling and data augmentation literature is ``interweaving'' between two data augmentions (\citet{yu2011center}). This method was used by \citet{kastner2013ancillarity} to improve the MCMC estimation of stochastic volatility models. We apply this idea in the context of a dynamic linear model (DLM) in order to explore alternative methods of constructing a Gibbs sampler. In Section \ref{sec:DLMmodel} we introduce the model. In Section \ref{sec:DLMest} we discuss data augmentation methods generally, introduce several new data augmentations for this class of models and show that it is unlikely that a useful sufficient augmentation (centered augmentation) exists when we consider all model parameters as unknown. Section \ref{sec:DLMinter} contains several interweaving algorithms based on the various data augmentations we discuss in Section \ref{sec:DLMest}. In Section \ref{sec:LLMest} we work out an example with the local level model and report the results of fitting the model to different simulated datasets using several of the MCMC samplers we construct. Finally Section \ref{sec:Discussion} discusses our results and concludes.
